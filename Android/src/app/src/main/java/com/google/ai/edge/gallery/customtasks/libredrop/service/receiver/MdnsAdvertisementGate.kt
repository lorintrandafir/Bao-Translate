/**
 * Drives the mDNS advertisement lifecycle from BLE pulse activity and
 * a small set of override flags (issue #34).
 *
 * Stock Quick Share does not broadcast mDNS continuously — only while a
 * sender's BLE pulse is detected. This gate matches that behaviour by
 * subscribing to:
 *
 *  * [bleActivity] — `StateFlow<ScanActivity>` from
 *    `BleQuickShareScanner` (#33). When the most recent value is
 *    [ScanActivity.Active] we want to publish.
 *  * [alwaysVisibleOverride] — sticky user-controlled "always visible"
 *    toggle. When `true`, we publish unconditionally so the receiver
 *    works on devices where BLE scan is unavailable (no permission, no
 *    LE hardware) or where the user simply wants to be discoverable
 *    while the BLE side is asleep.
 *  * [qrSessionActive] — when a QR-code-based receive flow is in
 *    progress (the in-app counterpart to #1.16, hooked into the
 *    existing #84/#86 QR display path), the gate is bypassed entirely
 *    and the advertisement stays up. The current build only exposes
 *    the hook; the QR flow itself toggles it when the relevant code
 *    lands.
 *
 * ### Debounce
 *
 * After mDNS goes up, it stays up for at least
 * [debounceIdleMillis] (default 30 s) to avoid flapping if the BLE
 * pulse is intermittent. Concretely:
 *
 *  * BLE flips Idle → Active: publish immediately, cancel any pending
 *    unpublish.
 *  * BLE flips Active → Idle: schedule an unpublish [debounceIdleMillis]
 *    later.
 *  * BLE flips back to Active before the timer fires: cancel the timer,
 *    keep the advertisement up.
 *  * Override flips on: publish immediately, cancel any pending
 *    unpublish.
 *  * Override flips off (and BLE is Idle): schedule an unpublish
 *    [debounceIdleMillis] later.
 *
 * The debounce window is chosen to match #34's acceptance criterion
 * verbatim.
 *
 * ### Concurrency
 *
 * The gate runs on a single coroutine launched in [scope]. All the
 * publish/unpublish state is owned by that coroutine — no locks are
 * needed beyond the ones [ReceiverSession] already holds internally.
 *
 * The gate does **not** own the publish lifecycle past its own scope:
 * if the receiver service stops, [stop] cancels the gate but leaves the
 * session to run its own teardown order (which closes any in-flight
 * AdvertiseHandle as part of its `stop()` path). This keeps the gate's
 * stop-order trivially safe regardless of which side cancels first.
 *
 * @param session the receiver session whose advertisement is gated.
 * @param bleActivity scanner activity flow sourced from
 *   `BleQuickShareScanner.activity` via [ActiveBleScannerHolder].
 * @param alwaysVisibleOverride sticky user-controlled override.
 * @param qrSessionActive QR-code-flow bypass flag.
 * @param outboundSessionActive when `true`, vetoes any publish decision
 *   and tears the mDNS record down. Used by `SendActivity` to prevent
 *   the receiver-side mDNS publish from racing with our outbound
 *   connection — Samsung One UI 8.0.5's GMS Nearby caches state for
 *   our endpoint from the discovered WIFI_LAN service and then fails
 *   `securegcm::UKey2Handshake::ParseHandshakeMessage` on the incoming
 *   `client_finished` from the same IP. See
 *   [OutboundSessionActiveHolder] for the full rationale.
 * @param debounceIdleMillis time after the last "should publish" signal
 *   before the gate unpublishes the advertisement. 30 s by default per
 *   issue #34.
 * @param publishRetryDelayMillis time after a failed mDNS publish before
 *   retrying while any publish signal remains active. This covers radio
 *   recovery cases where the first publish attempt happens while Wi-Fi
 *   or Bluetooth is still unavailable, and Android does not emit a gate
 *   input change after the radio becomes usable.
