/**
 * Persistent foreground service that hosts the inbound Quick Share
 * listener. Android 14+ requires every foreground service to declare a
 * specific type; `connectedDevice` is the right one for peer-to-peer
 * file transfer over Wi-Fi (and, in Phase 2, BLE).
 *
 * ### Why a foreground service
 *
 * We need to be reachable to senders while the user has navigated away
 * from the app, the screen is off, or the device is in
 * Doze/App-Standby. Foreground services are the documented Android
 * mechanism for this — the system schedules them generously, kills
 * them last under memory pressure, and surfaces a persistent
 * notification so the user is never surprised about resource usage.
 *
 * ### Manifest declarations required
 *
 *  - `<service android:foregroundServiceType="connectedDevice"/>` on
 *    this class.
 *  - `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>`
 *  - `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CONNECTED_DEVICE"/>`
 *    (the latter is API 34+ only — guarded with `tools:targetApi`).
 *
 * ### Lifecycle
 *
 * The bulk of this class is plumbing; the actual coordination lives in
 * [ReceiverSession]. The service:
 *
 *  1. Creates the notification channel on first start (idempotent).
 *  2. Builds a [ReceiverSession] and calls `start()` on a coroutine
 *     under [serviceScope].
 *  3. Calls `startForeground` with the persistent notification so
 *     Android promotes the service immediately (must happen within
 *     `Service.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_GRACE_PERIOD_MS` after `startService`).
 *  4. On `onDestroy` — or on an explicit `ACTION_STOP` intent —
 *     calls [ReceiverSession.stop], cancels the scope, and exits.
 *
 * Returning [START_STICKY] tells Android to resurrect the service if
 * the system kills it under memory pressure. The user-visible
 * notification keeps state across that resurrection.
 *
 * ### Public entry points
 *
 *  - [Companion.start] — convenience for callers that just want to
 *    bring the service up. Wraps the
 *    `ContextCompat.startForegroundService` boilerplate.
 *  - [Companion.stop] — symmetric stop.
 *
 * ### Dependency injection
 *
 * For tests, the service exposes [Companion.sessionFactoryOverride].
 * Production paths use the default factory which wires up a real
 * `MediaStoreDownloadsFactory` and a real `Discovery` instance against
 * the application context. The override is process-wide but only
 * consulted on `onCreate`; a unit test can install a fake, spawn a
 * service via Robolectric, and observe the resulting [ReceiverSession]
 * interactions without touching real Android subsystems. Phase 1 keeps
 * the override path purely as a seam — the
 * `ReceiverSession` itself is exhaustively unit-tested on plain JVM
 * (see [ReceiverSession]) so the service body remains the only
 * Android-coupled surface.
